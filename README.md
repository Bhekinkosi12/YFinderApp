# YFinder Server-Side Capstone

## YFinder is a Xamarin Forms mobile iOS app for students and professionals to rate their favorite hotspots to work and study. It uses iPhone's GPS and WiFi sensors to gauge location coordinates and connectivity strength. It is powered by YFinder C#/NET Core 2.0 API, custom written for this app.

## This is my first dive into Xamarin (and mobile apps in general) from C#, and I'm excited to share this and other projects with you at NSS demo day on 9/22.
